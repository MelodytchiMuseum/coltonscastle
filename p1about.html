			<h1>Why I Chose This</h1>
			<p>Since I was 5 years old, I have always wanted to make my own video games. I started learning how to program when I was 13, using a simple program called Game Maker. Later on, I started teaching myself C and C++. Since I started programming, I have come to appreciate it as a hobby. Therefore, I would like to turn it into a career in the future. Although I will settle for almost anyone programming career now, I still program games for fun in my spare time.</p>
			<br/>
			<h1>Step 2</h1>
			<p>I honestly did not draw inspiration from many other websites. The "Games" page on <a href = "http://ericruthgames.weebly.com/games.html">Eric Ruth Games'</a> website partially inspired the layout of my home page. The way the screenshots are organized on the game pages is inspired by typical image hosting websites like <a href = "http://imgur.com">Imgur</a>.</p> 
			<br/>
			<h1>Step 3</h1>
			<p>I did not storyboard my website in a way others typically would. I had the basic design visualized in my head, and I instead wrote down what pages there would be and what info would be on each page. I did stray from the design I visualized a little, only to make the site look nicer. You can view the "storyboard" file <a href = "StoryboardNew.txt">here</a>.</p>
			<br/>
			<h1>Step 4</h1>
			<p>Every single image on the site was actually made by me. They all come from games I had made (but not finished) over the past few years. The screesnshots are simply screenshots of gameplay. The banners and titles, however, are actually new images made with the graphics from each game. I pretended these games were "finished" for the website by selectively taking elements of the games that were finished but looked different from each other to create screenshot variety.</p>
